# MeshViewer
Matlab GUI for visualization and manipulation of 3D meshes

This GUI aims at facilitate the visualization and the manipulation of 3D meshes that can be generated in our researches. 
It provides user-friendly access to some of the features implemented within the MatGeom toolbox.

# Installation

Extract the project, andrun the file "MeshViewer.m". 
A default GUI is created, that also allows to open some OFF or PLY files stored on the local computer.

# Dependencies

* [MatGeom Toolbox](https://github.com/mattools/matGeom), for the geometry processing operations
* [GUI Layout V2](https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox) for GUI
* [GenericDialog](https://github.com/mattools/GenericDialog), a generic dialog for Matlab, mimicking ImageJ's functionalities
